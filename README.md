**Production-ready AWS email infrastructure that runs entirely in your account**

SESMailEngine is AWS-native email infrastructure that solves the scattered email logic problem. Instead of managing email code across multiple Lambda functions, get a centralized solution that scales to zero when idle and avoids recurring monthly contracts.

## What We Built This For

While building production SaaS applications on AWS, we faced a common problem: **email logic scattered across multiple Lambda functions**. We needed a centralized solution that:

- **Runs entirely in our AWS account** - Full control, no external dependencies
- **Scales to zero when idle** - Pay only when you send, not monthly fees
- **Avoids recurring contracts** - One-time purchase, unlimited projects

When no existing solution met these requirements, we built SESMailEngine.

## What We Are

- **Production-ready AWS email infrastructure** - Deploy in minutes with CloudFormation
- **One-time purchase, unlimited projects** - No per-seat or monthly subscription fees
- **Full control in your AWS account** - You own and control all email data
- **Zero idle costs** - Pay only AWS usage when you send emails
- **Simple EventBridge integration** - Publish events, we handle the rest

## What We're Not

- **Not a managed service** - You deploy and own the infrastructure
- **Not a marketing automation platform** - We focus on transactional email infrastructure
- **Not a drag-and-drop email builder** - Use your own templates or our starter templates
- **Not a per-seat subscription** - One license, unlimited team members
- **Not a black box** - You see everything, full CloudFormation source included

## Key Features

### 🛡️ Automatic Reputation Protection
- **Hard and soft bounce handling** with automatic suppression
- **Spam complaint management** with cross-campaign protection
- **Automatic sending pause** when bounce thresholds are exceeded
- **Cross-campaign protection** prevents repeat offenders

### 📊 Built-in Tracking & Analytics
- **Track every email in real time** - sent, delivered, bounced, complained, opened
- **Query by recipient, message ID, or date** using DynamoDB indexes
- **Full audit trail** with retry tracking and status transitions
- **Zero data loss architecture** - every email is tracked

### 🚨 6 Pre-Configured CloudWatch Alarms
- **Bounce rate monitoring** (>3% triggers alert, AWS suspends at ~5%)
- **Complaint rate monitoring** (>0.05% triggers alert, AWS suspends at ~0.1%)
- **Lambda error detection** for sustained issues
- **Dead Letter Queue monitoring** for failed processing
- **Admin notifications** enabled out of the box

### 🔒 No Silent Failures
- **Three Dead Letter Queues** capture every failure type
- **Automatic retries** for soft bounces with intelligent backoff
- **All data encrypted at rest** across S3, DynamoDB, and SQS
- **Comprehensive error tracking** with detailed failure reasons

### 📧 Production-Ready Templates
- **Jinja2 templates** stored in S3 with versioning enabled
- **8 starter templates included** (welcome, password reset, invoices, etc.)
- **Template seeder Lambda** for one-command setup
- **Responsive design** with Outlook compatibility

### ⚡ Deploy in Minutes
- **Single CloudFormation template** with 10+ configuration options
- **Cross-platform Python installer** handles everything automatically
- **Production-ready infrastructure** in under 10 minutes
- **Zero external dependencies** - pure AWS services
## Perfect For

### 🚀 SaaS Applications
Onboard users, announce features, and handle billing notifications. EventBridge-triggered sending and Jinja2 templates let you scale effortlessly without increasing costs.

### 💳 Transactional Emails
Deliver critical communications like password resets, order confirmations, and shipping updates. Automatic bounce handling and reputation protection ensure high delivery rates.

### 🔔 Notification Systems
Send alerts, digests, and summaries from any AWS service. With CloudWatch alarms and Lambda integration, you can monitor delivery and errors in real time.

### 🛒 E-commerce
Email receipts, shipping notifications, and review requests at high volume. Suppression lists and bounce handling protect your sender reputation while keeping costs low.

### 🏢 Internal Tools
Keep your team informed with monitoring alerts, reports, and notifications. No per-seat pricing, full AWS-native infrastructure, and flexible templates make it ideal for internal communications.

### 📱 Mobile Apps
Handle account verifications, push fallback emails, and engagement campaigns. Dynamic templates, S3 versioning, and EventBridge triggers make mobile email reliable and scalable.
## Quick Start

### Python
```python
import boto3
import json

events = boto3.client('events')

response = events.put_events(
    Entries=[{
        'Source': 'my.application',
        'DetailType': 'Email Request',
        'EventBusName': 'sesmailengine-EmailBus',  # Your stack name
        'Detail': json.dumps({
            'to': 'recipient@example.com',
            'templateName': 'welcome',
            'templateData': {
                'userName': 'John',
                'companyName': 'My Company'
            }
        })
    }]
)
```

### TypeScript/Node.js
```typescript
import { EventBridgeClient, PutEventsCommand } from '@aws-sdk/client-eventbridge';

const client = new EventBridgeClient({});

const command = new PutEventsCommand({
  Entries: [{
    Source: 'my.application',
    DetailType: 'Email Request',
    EventBusName: 'sesmailengine-EmailBus',  // Your stack name
    Detail: JSON.stringify({
      to: 'recipient@example.com',
      templateName: 'welcome',
      templateData: {
        userName: 'John',
        companyName: 'My Company'
      }
    })
  }]
});

await client.send(command);
```
